# THIS REPOSITORY IS NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED

The content is now being maintained by the jQuery Project at the [learn.jquery.com repo](https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com).


jQuery Fundamentals will be serving as the basis for a new jQuery learning site
maintained by the jQuery project, and ongoing maintenance and support for this
content will transfer to the jQuery project. For more details, see my [blog
post](http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/the-future-of-jquery-fundamentals-and-a-confe).

Please do not open issues on this repo; use the new jQuery Project repo instead.
