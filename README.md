## Building This Book ##
For editing and collaborating purposes, the contents of jQuery Fundamentals is broken into parts and chapters. If you would like to build a copy, simply type "make" in your terminal or console in the root folder of the project. If you are a windows user, you'll need either [GNU Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm) or [cygwin](http://cygwin.com/). For example:

Clone the jqfundamentals repository to your local machine<br>
`> git clone https://github.com/rmurphey/jqfundamentals.git`

Change to the newly cloned repository's directory<br>
`> cd jqfundamentals`

Make the book<br>
`> make`

This will create a folder called `/publish/` with the `index.html` file contents of the `/book/include/` folder inside of it.
