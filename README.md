# jQuery Fundamentals Training Material #
This repository contains evolving content to be used as teaching material for a jQuery Fundamentals class, including exercises, solutions, and a web-based book. 

If you're looking for the latest release of the book, visit <http://www.rebeccamurphey.com/jqfundamentals/> or download the [most recent tag](http://github.com/rmurphey/jqfundamentals/downloads) and navigate to /book/release/html/. 

## Contributing ##
This material is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 US license because I am eager to see other people contribute to it. Pull requests are welcome and encouraged! Check out the Issues page for the project to see the most recent list of things that still need to be done. 

The content of the book is written in [DocBook 5.0](http://www.docbook.org/), which is slightly painful to write in due to the lack of good free XML editors, but which generates all sorts of outputs, including HTML and PDF. I used the free version of [XMLEditor](http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/) to generate the chapter files. If you're interested in contributing content but don't want to deal with DocBook, let me know and we can work something out. Also, if you have existing content that you think would be good to include in the book, let me know that too! You will, of course, be credited for any contributions.

## Using This Material ##
Per the license, you are welcome to use this material; if you're using it to teach a class, I'd love for you to let me know about it.

## Generating the HTML ##
From the /book directory, run

`./scripts/install.sh`

Then, run

`./scripts/publish.sh`

You can also output other formats:

`./scripts/publish-pdf.sh`

`./scripts/publish-epub.sh`
