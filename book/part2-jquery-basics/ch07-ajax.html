            <p>
              The XMLHttpRequest method (XHR) allows browsers to communicate with the server without requiring a page reload. This method, also known as Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), allows for web pages that provide rich, interactive experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ajax requests are triggered by JavaScript code; your code sends a request to a URL, and when it receives a response, a callback function can be triggered to handle the response. Because the request is asynchronous, the rest of your code continues to execute while the request is being processed, so it’s imperative that a callback be used to handle the response.
            </p>
            <p>
              jQuery provides Ajax support that abstracts away painful browser differences. It offers both a full-featured <code class="code">$.ajax()</code> method, and simple convenience methods such as <code class="code">$.get()</code>, <code class="code">$.getScript()</code>, <code class="code">$.getJSON()</code>, <code class="code">$.post()</code>, and <code class="code">$().load()</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most jQuery applications don’t in fact use XML, despite the name “Ajax”; instead, they transport data as plain HTML or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
            </p>
            <p>
              In general, Ajax does not work across domains. Exceptions are services that provide JSONP (JSON with Padding) support, which allow limited cross-domain functionality.

              </div>
              <p>
                The two most common “methods” for sending a request to a server are GET and POST. It’s important to understand the proper application of each.
              </p>
              <p>
                The GET method should be used for non-destructive operations — that is, operations where you are only “getting” data from the server, not changing data on the server. For example, a query to a search service might be a GET request. GET requests may be cached by the browser, which can lead to unpredictable behavior if you are not expecting it. GET requests generally send all of their data in a query string.
              </p>
              <p>
                The POST method should be used for destructive operations — that is, operations where you are changing data on the server. For example, a user saving a blog post should be a POST request. POST requests are generally not cached by the browser; a query string can be part of the URL, but the data tends to be sent separately as post data.

                jQuery generally requires some instruction as to the type of data you expect to get back from an Ajax request; in some cases the data type is specified by the method name, and in other cases it is provided as part of a configuration object. There are several options:

                      As of jQuery 1.4, if the JSON data sent by your server isn't properly formatted, the request may fail silently. See <a href="http://json.org" class="ulink">http://json.org</a> for details on properly formatting JSON, but as a general rule, use built-in language methods for generating JSON on the server to avoid syntax issues.

              </div>
              <p>
                The asynchronicity of Ajax catches many new jQuery users off guard. Because Ajax calls are asynchronous by default, the response is not immediately available. Responses can only be handled using a callback. So, for example, the following code will not work:
              </p>
              <pre class="brush: js">
var response;
$.get('foo.php', function(r) { response = r; });
console.log(response); <span class="emphasis"><em>// undefined!</em></span>
</pre>
              <p>
                Instead, we need to pass a callback function to our request; this callback will run when the request succeeds, at which point we can access the data that it returned, if any.
              </p>
              <pre class="brush: js">
$.get('foo.php', function(response) { console.log(response); });
</pre>

                  Same-Origin Policy and JSONP
                </h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                In general, Ajax requests are limited to the same protocol (http or https), the same port, and the same domain as the page making the request. This limitation does not apply to scripts that are loaded via jQuery's Ajax methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                The other exception is requests targeted at a JSONP service on another domain. In the case of JSONP, the provider of the service has agreed to respond to your request with a script that can be loaded into the page using a <code class="code">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, thus avoiding the same-origin limitation; that script will include the data you requested, wrapped in a callback function you provide.

                Firebug (or the Webkit Inspector in Chrome or Safari) is an invaluable tool for working with Ajax requests. You can see Ajax requests as they happen in the Console tab of Firebug (and in the Resources &gt; XHR panel of Webkit Inspector), and you can click on a request to expand it and see details such as the request headers, response headers, response content, and more. If something isn't going as expected with an Ajax request, this is the first place to look to track down what's wrong.

              While jQuery does offer many Ajax-related convenience methods, the core <code class="code">$.ajax</code> method is at the heart of all of them, and understanding it is imperative. We'll review it first, and then touch briefly on the convenience methods.

              <i><span class="remark">I generally use the $.ajax method and do not use convenience methods. As you'll see, it offers features that the convenience methods do not, and its syntax is more easily understandable, in my opinion.</span></i>

            <p>
              jQuery’s core <code class="code">$.ajax</code> method is a powerful and straightforward way of creating Ajax requests. It takes a configuration object that contains all the instructions jQuery requires to complete the request. The <code class="code">$.ajax</code> method is particularly valuable because it offers the ability to specify both success and failure callbacks. Also, its ability to take a configuration object that can be defined separately makes it easier to write reusable code.

              A note about the <code class="code">dataType</code> setting: if the server sends back data that is in a different format than you specify, your code may fail, and the reason will not always be clear, because the HTTP response code will not show an error. When working with Ajax requests, make sure your server is sending back the data type you're asking for, and verify that the Content-type header is accurate for the data type. For example, for JSON data, the Content-type header should be <code class="code">application/json</code>.

                If you don't need the extensive configurability of <code class="code">$.ajax</code>, and you don't care about handling errors, the Ajax convenience functions provided by jQuery can be useful, terse ways to accomplish Ajax requests. These methods are just "wrappers" around the core <code class="code">$.ajax</code> method, and simply pre-set some of the options on the <code class="code">$.ajax</code> method.
              </p>
              <p>

                The <code class="code">$.fn.load</code> method is unique among jQuery’s Ajax methods in that it is called on a selection.

In addition to providing a URL to the method, you can optionally provide a selector; jQuery will fetch only the matching content from the returned HTML.

              jQuery’s ajax capabilities can be especially useful when dealing with forms. The <a href="http://jquery.malsup.com/form/" class="ulink">jQuery Form Plugin</a> is a well-tested tool for adding Ajax capabilities to forms, and you should generally use it for handling forms with Ajax rather than trying to roll your own solution for anything remotely complex. That said, there are a two jQuery methods you should know that relate to form processing in jQuery: <code class="code">$.fn.serialize</code> and <code class="code">$.fn.serializeArray</code>.

              Working with JSONP
            </h2>
            <p>
              The advent of JSONP &mdash; essentially a consensual cross-site
              scripting hack &mdash; has opened the door to powerful mashups of content. Many prominent sites provide JSONP services, allowing you access to their content via a predefined API. A particularly great source of JSONP-formatted data is the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/" class="ulink">Yahoo! Query Language</a>, which we'll use in the following example to fetch news about cats.
            </p>

              <p class="title">
                <b>Using YQL and JSONP</b>

                <pre class="brush: js">
$.ajax({
    url : 'http://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql',

    // the name of the callback parameter,
    // as specified by the YQL service

    // tell jQuery we're expecting JSONP
    dataType : 'jsonp',

    // tell YQL what we want and that we want JSON
    data : {
        q : 'select title,abstract,url from search.news where query="cat"',
        format : 'json'
    },

    // work with the response
    success : function(response) {

    }
});

            </div>

              jQuery handles all the complex aspects of JSONP behind-the-scenes
              &mdash; all we have to do is tell jQuery the name of the JSONP callback parameter specified by YQL ("callback" in this case), and otherwise the whole process looks and feels like a normal Ajax request.

                  </li>
                  <li>Bind to the change event of the select element; when the user changes the selection, send an Ajax request to <code class="filename">/exercises/data/specials.json</code>.
                  </li>
                  <li>When the request returns a response, use the value the user selected in the select (hint: <code class="code">$.fn.val</code>) to look up information about the special in the JSON response.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Add some HTML about the special to the target div you created.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Finally, because the form is now Ajax-enabled, remove the submit button from the form.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </div>
              <p>
                Note that we're loading the JSON every time the user changes their selection. How could we change the code so we only make the request once, and then use a cached response when the user changes their choice in the select?
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
