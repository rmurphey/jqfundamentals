  <title>Code Organization</title>

  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>When you move beyond adding simple enhancements to your website with
    jQuery and start developing full-blown client-side applications, you need
    to consider how to organize your code. In this chapter, we'll take a look
    at various code organization patterns you can use in your jQuery
    application and explore why code organization is important.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Key Concepts</title>

      <para>Before we jump into code organization patterns, it's important to
      understand some concepts that are common to all good code organization
      patterns.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Your code should be divided into units of functionality —
          modules, services, etc. Avoid the temptation to have all of your
          code in one huge $(document).ready() block.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Despite jQuery's DOM-centric nature, JavaScript applications
          are not all about the DOM. Remember that not all pieces of
          functionality need to — or should — have a DOM
          representation.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Units of functionality should be loosely coupled — a unit of
          functionality should be able to exist on its own, and communication
          between units should be handled via a messaging system such as
          custom events or pub/sub. Stay away from direct communication
          between units of functionality whenever possible. </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Units of functionality should be divided into small methods
          that do exactly one thing. If your methods are more than a few lines
          long, you may need to consider refactoring.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Configuration options for your units of functionality — URLs,
          strings, timeouts, etc. — should be set in properties or a
          configuration object, not scattered throughout the code.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The concept of loose coupling can be especially troublesome to
      developers making their first foray into complex applications, so be
      mindful of this as you're getting started.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Organizational Structures</title>

    <para>There are several ways </para>

    <section>
      <title>The Object Literal</title>

      <para>An object literal is perhaps the simplest way to organize your
      code. It doesn't offer any of the many features provided by other
      techniques, but it's a good starting point for discussion.</para>

      <example>
        <title>An object literal</title>

        <programlisting>var myFeature = {
    myProperty : 'hello',

    myMethod : function() {
        console.log(myFeature.myProperty);
    },

    init : function(settings) {
        myFeature.settings = settings;
    },

    readSettings : function() {
        console.log(myFeature.settings);
    }
};

myFeature.myProperty; // 'hello'
myFeature.myMethod(); // logs 'hello'
myFeature.init({ foo : 'bar' });
myFeature.readSettings(); // logs { foo : 'bar' }
</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>The object literal above is simply an object assigned to a
      variable. The object has one property and several methods. All of the
      properties and methods are public, so any part of your application can
      see the properties and call methods on the object. While there is an
      init method, there's nothing requiring that it be called before the
      object is functional. </para>

      <para>How would we apply this pattern to jQuery code? Let's say that we
      had this code written in the traditional jQuery style:</para>

      <programlisting>// clicking on a list item loads some content
// using the list item's ID and hides content
// in sibling list items
$(document).ready(function() {
  $('#myFeature li')
    .append('&lt;div/&gt;')
    .click(function() {
      var $this = $(this);
      var $div = $this.find('div');
      $div.load('foo.php?item=' +
        $this.attr('id'), 
        function() {
          $div.show();
          $this.siblings()
            .find('div').hide();
        }
      );
    });
});
</programlisting>

      <para>If this were the extent of our application, leaving it as-is would
      be fine. On the other hand, if this was a piece of a larger application,
      we'd do well to keep this functionality separate from unrelated
      functionality. We might also want to move the URL out of the code and
      into a configuration area. Finally, we might want to break up the chain
      to make it easier to modify pieces of the functionality later. </para>

      <example>
        <title>Using an object literal for a jQuery feature</title>

        <programlisting>var myFeature = {
    init : function(settings) {
        myFeature.config = {
            $items : $('#myFeature li'),
            $container : $('&lt;div class="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'),
            urlBase : '/foo.php?item='
        };

        // allow overriding the default config
        $.extend(myFeature.config, settings);

        myFeature.setup();        
    },

    setup : function() {
        myFeature.config.$items
            .each(myFeature.createContainer)
            .click(myFeature.showItem);
    },

    createContainer : function() {
        var $i = $(this),
            $c = myFeature.$container.clone()
                     .appendTo($i);

        $i.data('container', $c);
    },
    
    buildUrl : function() {
        return myFeature.config.urlBase + 
               myFeature.$currentItem.attr('id');
    },
    
    showItem : function() {
        var myFeature.$currentItem = $(this);
        myFeature.getContent(myFeature.showContent);
    },
    
    getContent : function(callback) {
        var url = myFeature.buildUrl();
        myFeature.$currentItem
            .data('container').load(url, callback);
    },
    
    showContent : function() {
        myFeature.$currentItem
            .data('container').show();
        myFeature.hideContent();
    },
    
    hideContent : function() {
        myFeature.$currentItem.siblings()
            .each(function() { 
                $(this).data('container').hide(); 
            });
    }
};

$(document).ready(myFeature.init);</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>The first thing you'll notice is that this approach is obviously
      far longer than the original — again, if this were the extent of our
      application, using an object literal would make no sense at all.
      Assuming it's not the extent of our application, though, we've gained
      several things:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>We've broken our feature up into tiny methods; in the future,
          if we want to change how content is shown, it's clear where to
          change it. In the original code, this step is much harder to
          locate.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>We've moved configuration options out of the body of the code
          and put them in a central location.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>We've eliminated the constraints of the chain, making the code
          easier to refactor, remix, and rearrange.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>For non-trivial features, object literals are a clear improvement
      over a long stretch of code stuffed in a $(document).ready() block, as
      they get us thinking about the pieces of our functionality. However,
      they aren't a whole lot more advanced than simply having a bunch of
      function declarations inside of that $(document).ready() block. </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>The Module Pattern</title>

      <example>
        <title>The module pattern</title>

        <programlisting>var featureCreator = function() {
    var privateThing = 'secret',
        publicThing = 'not secret',

        changePrivateThing = function() {
            privateThing = 'super secret';
        },

        sayPrivateThing = function() {
            console.log(privateThing);
            changePrivateThing();
        };

    return {
        publicThing : publicThing,
        sayPrivateThing : sayPrivateThing
    }
};

var feature = featureCreator();
feature.publicThing; // 'not secret'
feature.sayPrivateThing(); 
// logs 'secret' and changes the value
// of privateThing</programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>In the example above, we create a function featureCreator that
      returns an object. Inside of the function, we define some variables.
      Because the variables are defined inside of the function, we don't have
      access to them outside of the function unless we put them in the return
      object. This means that no code outside of the function has access to
      the privateThing variable or to the changePrivateThing function.
      However, sayPrivateThing does have access to privateThing and
      changePrivateThing, because both were defined in the same scope as
      sayPrivateThing.</para>

      <para>This pattern is powerful because, as you can gather from the
      variable names, it can give you private variables and functions while
      exposing a limited API consisting of the returned object's properties
      and methods.</para>
